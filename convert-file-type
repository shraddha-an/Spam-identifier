In its original form, the dataset is made available as a data file with the extension '.data'

To use the data in our code, we will have to change the file type, as:
1) Open the spambase.data file in Excel.
2) Click on the column 'A' so as to select the entire first column.
3) Click on "Text to Columns" button under the 'Data' tab.
4) Select the following in the series of dialog boxes: "Delimited" -> "Comma" -> "Finish".
5) Select "Save As.." option from the File drop-down menu and save it as a .csv file.
